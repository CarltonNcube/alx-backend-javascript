Tasks
0. Basic list of objects
Create a function named getListStudents that returns an array of objects. Each object should have three attributes: id (Number), firstName (String), and location (String). The array contains a specific list of students in order.

1. More mapping
Create a function getListStudentIds that returns an array of ids from a list of objects. The function takes an array of objects as an argument.

2. Filter
Create a function getStudentsByLocation that returns an array of objects located in a specific city. It should accept a list of students and a city as parameters.

3. Reduce
Create a function getStudentIdsSum that returns the sum of all student ids. It should accept a list of students as a parameter.

4. Combine
Create a function updateStudentGradeByCity that returns an array of students for a specific city with their new grades. It should accept a list of students, a city, and new grades as parameters.

5. Typed Arrays
Create a function createInt8TypedArray that returns a new ArrayBuffer with an Int8 value at a specific position. It should accept three arguments: length, position, and value.

6. Set data structure
Create a function setFromArray that returns a Set from an array. It should accept an array of any kind of elements.

7. More set data structure
Create a function hasValuesFromArray that returns a boolean if all the elements in the array exist within the set. It should accept a Set and an array as arguments.

8. Clean set
Create a function cleanSet that returns a string of all the set values that start with a specific string. It should accept a Set and a startString as arguments.

9. Map data structure
Create a function groceriesList that returns a map of groceries with specific items and quantities.

10. More map data structure
Create a function updateUniqueItems that returns an updated map for all items with an initial quantity at 1. It should accept a map as an argument.
